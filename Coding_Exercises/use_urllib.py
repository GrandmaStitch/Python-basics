# quote, quote_plus
# The URL quoting functions focus on taking program data 
# and making it safe for use as URL components by quoting special characters 
# and appropriately encoding non-ASCII text. 
# They also support reversing these operations to recreate the original data 
# from the contents of a URL component 
# if that task isnâ€™t already covered by the URL parsing functions above.
